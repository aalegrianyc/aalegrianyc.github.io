  I am most skilled in: <mark>spreadsheets</mark> and going <mark>vroom</mark>

            Public transit wasn't very popular in the shutdown times, so everyone that could buy a vehicle got one to them around. A lot of people decided that it was "now or never" moment to get a motorcycle. I was the only salesperson (outside of the general manager) to man the phones, inboxes, CRMs, and receive the clients at the shop. It was *wild*. I learned so much, loved being part of a such a small team, and had a great time.

          In my program, we explored economic behavior at the individual, national, and global levels, applying theoretical insights and analytical methods to modern-day challenges. 

          Emphasis was placed on strengthening our quantitative reasoning skills, from critically assessing existing statistics to producing original statistical data.
