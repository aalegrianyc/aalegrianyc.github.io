          using Money-Income & Equivalence-Adjusted Income metrics, as well as by Race.

            Public transit wasn't very popular in the shutdown times, so everyone that could buy a vehicle got one to them around. A lot of people decided that it was "now or never" moment to get a motorcycle. I was the only salesperson (outside of the general manager) to man the phones, inboxes, CRMs, and receive the clients at the shop. It was *wild*. I learned so much, loved being part of a such a small team, and had a great time.

          In my program, we explore economic behavior at the individual, national, and global levels, applying theory and analytical methods to modern-day challenges. 

          Emphasis is placed on strengthening our quantitative reasoning skills, from critically assessing existing statistics to producing original statistical data.

      Along with my interests in modifying tiny cells üìä and bikes both electric and acoustic üèçÔ∏è üö≤, some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - movies in other languages
      - calisthenics
      - friendship
      - any sort of protein wrapped in a carb
      - teaching my cat how to do cool tricks
      - not in that order
