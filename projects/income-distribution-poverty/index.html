    <h1>Income Distribution and Poverty Metrics</h1>
    
    <p>
        Hi! Below are two interactive spreadsheets and the charts I made with them showcasing 
        different analyses. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Definitions: Money-Income refers to the total income received by a household, 
        including wages, salaries, benefits, and other cash earnings, without adjustments for 
        household size or composition. On the other hand, Equivalence-Adjusted Income takes into 
        account household size and composition, adjusting the income measure to reflect the 
        different needs of households. 
    </p>  
    <p>  
        Summary: My aim was to gain a little bit more of a better understanding of the relationship 
        between income inequality and household size or needs (reflected by equivalence adjustments) 
        by examining each quintile and the top 5 percent of earners. While the slight changes observed 
        between the two years might suggest some recovery post-COVID, the data continues to show 
        significant income inequality, with the highest quintile owning about half of the nationâ€™s wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the second part of this project, I just wanted a preliminary look at poverty metrics
        as they pertained to race. The poverty rates show notable disparities that have persisted post-COVID, 
        though the analysis suggests that racial/ethnic differences in poverty rates are statistically 
        significant based on the margin of error.
    </p>

    <h2>i. Income Distribution using Money and Equivalence-Adjusted Income</h2>
    <p>
        The first is Table A-3 from the Census' data on income.
        Using the data, I created a clustered bar plot showing the share of aggregate income for each 
        quintile and the top 5 percent for 2021 and 2022 using Money-Income.
        Then I created a bar plot showing the same using Equivalence Adjusted Income. 
        I wanted to see the difference between the two years and the two types of income.
    </p>

        <img src="https://aalegrianyc.github.io/projects/income-distribution-poverty/images/distribution_money_income.png" alt="Income Distribution of Money Income">
    </div> 

    <div class="single-image-container-2">
        <img src="https://aalegrianyc.github.io/projects/income-distribution-poverty/images/distribution_equi_income.png" alt="Income Distribution of Equivalence-Adjusted Income">
    </div>  
    
    <p>
        There are very slight differences between 2021 and 2022 estimates. Similarly, there are
        very slight differences between money income and equivalence-adjusted income
        estimates. It doesn't appear that the estimates reveal any statistically significant change
        from year to year or depending on which measure is used when accounting for margin of
        error. The sobering estimates reveal a large income disparity: are that the highest quintile
        owns about 50% of the wealth in the US, with the top 5% owning 20% and the lowest
        owning about 3%.
    </p>

    <h2>ii. Poverty Rates by Race and Hispanic Origin</h2>
    <p>
        This is Table A-1 from the Census' data on poverty.
        I created a bar plot comparing poverty rates (percent in poverty) by Race and Hispanic Origin 
        for 2022, including error bars based on the reported margins of error. 
        I was looking to see if the differences in poverty rates seemed statistically significant.
    </p>

    <div class="iframe-container">
        <iframe 
            src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ycvww4kiO5inUmafHtwFcsVMIEuwX0Q4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114315212370392701119&rtpof=true&sd=true">
        </iframe>
    </div>

    <div class="image-container single-image-container-3">
        <img src="https://aalegrianyc.github.io/projects/income-distribution-poverty/images/poverty_rates_race_hispanic_new.png" alt="Poverty Rates by Race and Hispanic Origin">
    </div>
    
    <p>
        But without a rigorous method to have accurately determined if the differences are 
        statistically significant, I intuited that they are because the margin of error for each
        rate is small relatively with a 90% CI.
