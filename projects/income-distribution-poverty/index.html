    <h1>Data Analysis & Visualizations</h1>
    
    <p>
        Hi! Below are two interactive spreadsheets showcasing different analyses. 
         on <strong>financial trends</strong>, while the second explores <strong>market growth</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Income Distribution using Money and Equivalence-Adjusted Income</h2>
    <p>
        The first is Table A3 from the Census' data on income.
        Using the data, I created a bar plot showing the share of aggregate income for each 
        quintile and the top 5 percent for 2021 and 2022 using Money-Income.
        Then I created a bar plot showing the same using Equivalence Adjusted Income. 
        I wanted to see the difference between the two years and the two types of income.
    </p>

            src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OJY3TNBAPNKnxzXH6oD_ZLYYvq0G3nIX/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114315212370392701119&rtpof=true&sd=true">

    <img src="projects/project_name/images/distribution_equi_income.png" alt="Income Distribution of Equivalence-Adjusted Income">

    <p>
        There are very slight differences between 2021 and 2022 estimates. Similarly, there are
        very slight differences between money income and equivalence-adjusted income
        estimates. It doesn't appear that the estimates reveal any statistically significant change
        from year to year or depending on which measure is used when accounting for margin of
        error. The sobering estimates reveal a large income disparity: are that the highest quintile
        owns about 50% of the wealth in the US, with the top 5% owning 20% and the lowest
        owning about 3%.
    </p>

    <h2>Poverty Rates by Race and Hispanic Origin</h2>
    <p>
        This is Table A-1 from the Census' data on poverty.
        I created a bar plot comparing poverty rates (percent in poverty) by Race and Hispanic Origin 
        for 2022, including error bars based on the reported margins of error. 
        I was looking to see if the differences in poverty rates seemed statistically significant.
        
        But without a rigorous method to have accurately determined if the differences are 
        statistically significant, I intuited that they are not because the margin of error for each
        rate is small relatively with a 90% CI.
    </p>
